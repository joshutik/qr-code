## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow Bootsrap

### What I learned

I learnt How to use the Bootstrap grid system using the 'col' class to make the content 
responsive on all screen. and also learnt a new thing about the card system.


These are the code snippets, see below:

```html with Bootstrap class
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development
The outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. are adding functionalities using JavaScript and other programming languages.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - This helped me understand how to use the custom class. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
